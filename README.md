What Is Customer Churn?

Customer churn is one of the most important metrics for a growing business to evaluate. While it's not the happiest measure, it's a number that can give your company the hard truth about its customer retention

It's hard to measure success if you don't measure the inevitable failures, too. While you strive for 100% of customers to stick with your company, that's simply unrealistic. That's where customer churn comes in.



How to Reduce Customer Churn

Focus your attention on your best customers. Rather than simply focusing on offering incentives to customers who are considering churning, it could be even more beneficial to pool your resources into your loyal, profitable customers.



Analyze churn as it occurs. Use your churned customers as a means of understanding why customers are leaving. Analyze how and when churn occurs in a customer's lifetime with your company, and use that data to put into place preemptive measures.



Show your customers that you care. Instead of waiting to connect with your customers until they reach out to you, try a more proactive approach. Communicate with them all the perks you offer and show them you care about their experience, and they'll be sure to stick around.
